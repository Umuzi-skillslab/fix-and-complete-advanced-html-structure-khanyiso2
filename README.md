# Media Production Website Starter Code

This is the starter codebase for your media production website project. The code is approximately 70% complete but contains errors, omissions, and areas that need significant improvement.

## What's Included

- `index.html` - Home page (incomplete, semantic issues)
- `about.html` - About/Services page (incomplete, missing flexbox/grid layouts)
- `media.html` - Media gallery page (incomplete, missing media elements)
- `contact.html` - Contact page (incomplete form with validation issues)
- `css/styles.css` - Stylesheet (incomplete, missing advanced features)
- `images/` folder - Placeholder folder for your images
- `media/` folder - Placeholder folder for video/audio files

## Your Task

Review the provided code carefully and:
1. Identify and fix all HTML and CSS errors
2. Complete all missing advanced requirements
3. Add required media elements (video, audio, iframe)
4. Implement flexbox and CSS Grid layouts
5. Add CSS effects, transforms, transitions, and animations
6. Expand selector usage and add pseudo-classes
7. Improve code quality and organisation
8. Test across multiple browsers and validate all code

## Getting Started

1. Review all HTML and CSS files thoroughly
2. Run HTML through W3C Validator to identify errors
3. Run CSS through W3C CSS Validator
4. Identify missing advanced features (flexbox, grid, animations, etc.)
5. Test in multiple browsers
6. Fix all issues and complete missing requirements

## Notes

- You will need to add your own video and audio files to the `media/` folder
- You will need to add images to the `images/` folder
- The starter code intentionally has issues for you to discover and fix
- Advanced features like flexbox, grid, animations are missing or incomplete
- Refer to the project requirements document for all specifications

Good luck!

## Media Production Website
## Overview
This project is a professional media production website built using advanced HTML5 and CSS3 techniques. The website showcases services such as video production, audio recording, and photography. It includes four main pages: Home, About, Media, and Contact. The goal was to transform an incomplete starter codebase into a fully functional, responsive, and visually appealing website without using JavaScript.

## Issues Found
The starter code had several problems:

Overuse of <div> instead of semantic HTML elements
Missing metadata such as viewport and charset
No Flexbox or CSS Grid layouts
Missing media elements (audio, second video, iframe)
Incomplete and inaccessible form (no labels, no validation)
Images lacked <figure> and <figcaption>
No animations, transitions, or transforms
Limited CSS selectors and no pseudo-classes
Poor responsiveness and layout structure
Inconsistent code formatting and lack of comments
## Fixes and Implementations
## Semantic HTML & Metadata
Replaced <div> elements with semantic tags (header, nav, main, section, article, footer, figure)
Added proper metadata including charset, viewport, and description
Ensured consistent structure across all pages
## Media Integration
Added two video elements with controls and fallback content
Implemented an audio player with controls
Embedded a Google Maps iframe
Updated images using <figure> and <figcaption> for better accessibility
## Advanced Forms & Validation
Created a fully functional contact form with:
7+ input types (text, email, tel, url, date, number, radio, checkbox, select)
Proper <label> elements for accessibility
Grouping using <fieldset> and <legend>
HTML5 validation (required, pattern, min, max, minlength, maxlength)
## Flexbox Layouts
Implemented Flexbox for:
Navigation bar (horizontal responsive layout)
Services section (responsive cards layout)
Footer alignment
Used properties such as justify-content, align-items, and flex-wrap
CSS Grid Layout
Created a responsive grid layout for:
Portfolio section (About page)
Testimonials section (Media page)
Used grid-template-columns, gap, and minmax() with auto-fit for responsiveness
## Selectors & Pseudo-classes
Expanded CSS selectors to include:
Element, class, ID, attribute, descendant, child, and sibling selectors
Implemented pseudo-classes:
:hover, :focus, :nth-child(), :first-child, :last-child, :not(), :valid, :invalid
## Animations, Effects, and Transforms
Added text effects such as text-shadow and gradient text
Implemented transforms: scale, translate, and rotate
Added transitions for smooth hover effects
Created a keyframe animation (fadeIn) for page elements
Included an optional loading animation
## Accessibility Improvements
Added labels for all form inputs
Used semantic HTML for better screen reader support
Included alt attributes for all images
Structured content logically for usability
## Cross-Browser Compatibility
Tested website on Chrome and Firefox
Ensured consistent layout and styling across browsers
Fixed minor rendering differences using standard CSS practices
How to View the Website
Download or clone the repository
Open the project folder
Open index.html in any modern web browser
## Limitations
No backend functionality for form submission
Minor visual differences may occur on older browsers
## Reflection
One of the main challenges was identifying and fixing all structural and styling issues in the incomplete code. Implementing Flexbox and Grid layouts required careful planning to ensure responsiveness. Adding advanced CSS features like animations and pseudo-classes improved user experience significantly. Debugging validation errors and improving accessibility also helped create a more professional and user-friendly website.
